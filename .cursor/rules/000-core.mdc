# Core
- Output order: ExecSummary → Visual → Options → Roadmap → Automation → QA
- Language: KR concise + EN-inline when useful.
- Numerics: 2 decimals; Dates: ISO YYYY-MM-DD; TZ: Asia/Dubai.
- HallucinationBan: if uncertain, explicitly label with `가정:` and minimize inference.

# Scope Guard
- Default edit scope: `src/**` only.
- If changes outside `src/**` are necessary (CI, docs, config), do it as a minimal, auditable diff and record in changelog.

# Security
- Never commit or print secrets (tokens, PAT, keys).
- Do not broaden CORS in production; dev-only permissive settings must be gated by env.

# Evidence / Verification
- Before declaring done, run repo-appropriate checks (tests + lint + format at minimum).
