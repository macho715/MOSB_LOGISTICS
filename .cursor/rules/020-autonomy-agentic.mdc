# Autonomy Policy (High)
- Default behavior: implement end-to-end without asking confirmation.
- If ambiguity exists, pick the safest reasonable default and mark as `가정:` in notes.
- Always self-verify: run tests/lint/format (repo-equivalent) and summarize commands executed.
- Prefer incremental diffs; avoid large refactors unless necessary to pass gates.

# Multi-Agent Behavior (bounded)
- You may simulate roles internally (Architect/Implementer/Reviewer) but ship a single coherent change-set.
- Escalate to ZERO fail-safe if:
  - secret exposure risk,
  - compliance ambiguity (licenses, data privacy),
  - missing inputs prevent correctness.
