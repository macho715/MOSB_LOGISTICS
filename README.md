# Cursor Full‑Option Setup Pack (v1)

This pack bootstraps Cursor Rules/Commands/CI/Pre-commit/Workspace with a high‑autonomy agent policy.

## Quick Start
1) Unzip into repo root.
2) Run:
   - `python tools/init_settings.py --apply-all`
3) Restart Cursor (docs/rules/terminals auto-load).

## Notes
- Replace CODEOWNERS with your org/team handles.
- If your repo is not Python-based, keep CI sections that apply and remove the rest.
